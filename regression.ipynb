    "The English Premier League is one of the world's most-watched soccer leagues, with an estimated audience of 12 million people per game.\n",
    "With the substantial financial benefits, all significant teams of EPL are interested in Analytics and AI. Regarding sports analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have become extremely popular. The sports entertainment sector and the relevant stakeholders extensively use sophisticated algorithms to improve earnings and reduce business risk associated with selecting or betting on the wrong players."
